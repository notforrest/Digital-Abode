    This week, I did a lot of catching up for all of my classes. Trying to get all of assignments
    and due dates together is quite the task, but in the end, it seems that I've prevailed. Of
    course, that's just until now, where we'll have to do it all over again.

    For what's in my way, I've been incredibly busy these past two weeks and thus have been slacking
    very hard on my internship applications. Hopefully I'll be freer this upcoming week and be able
    to get way more done without essays and tests and other applications in my way.

    In the next week, I'll be pushing myself way more to get all of my applications in. I'm aiming
    to hit the big hundo by the end of this week, just so I can convince myself that I'm actually
    doing something productive for my future. Additionally, I'm super thankful that the BDP deadline
    got extended to tomorrow, so I'll be aiming to submit that tonight.

    The Liskov Substitution Principle, or LSP, seems like a pretty neat principle to keep in mind
    while coding. Being able to correctly obey and use inheritance is obviously an advantage in many
    situations. Some of the LSP paper can be slightly confusing as it became slightly wordy, but
    nonetheless it was a great read.

    I really enjoyed learning about arrays and vectors and especially what they're best at and used
    for. After Professor Downing explained how bad built-in arrays can be, it's pretty clear to me
    now how important the standard library array and vector are to any algorithm!

    What made me happy this week was the week ending, that's for sure. After multiple essays,
    assignments, and out-of-school activities, I have never been more relieved for the week to end.

    My tip for this week is this recent Computerphile video explaining the computer science behind
    AI Image Generators like DALL-E! Fascinating watch and it's great to see Computerphile break it
    down for us.
