    This past week, my partner and I completed Project 3: Allocator! We spent a good amount of time
    and surprisingly spent less time than I expected on potentially difficult-to-find bugs. One of
    the largest factors in our success was definitely the fact that we started early.

    The main thing in my way currently is my sleep schedule. Trying to juggle sleep, school, and ECs
    is something intense, that's for sure. I just need a reset week where I can sleep extremely
    early and wake up extremely. Every time I wake up early, I feel like my day is so long. I need
    that again.

    This next week, I'm planning on being much more aggressive with the middle-end of my internship
    search. I'm looking to have applied to over 100 by the end of Octoberâ€¦ and I'm not really
    on-track, hence the word aggressive. Other than that, I have my final IM Ultimate game coming up
    and I need to get back into bouldering. With school slowing down a little this week, I should be
    ready to focus on other things!

    The Dependency Inversion seems like a pretty simple topic where you basically look at older
    implementations for newer code. This backwards compatibility was something that I remember
    learning many years ago, and seeing it explained differently is nice.

    With stack, I'm fairly comfortable as I feel like I've been working with it for an eternity now.
    Keywords like explicit and friend are far more abstract to me. I genuinely still don't
    understand what those are, and I need to definitely do more research to brush up on those topics
    (or more like understand it at all).

    I'm extremely happy with the work that my partner and I had on Project 3: Allocator. We got a
    lot of work done over a long period of time and paced ourselves accordingly to finish a day
    early! Kind of. I also climbed again for the first time in a while, so that made me pretty happy
    (because then I'm not wasting my money heh).

    My pick-of-the-week is directly related to my self-research on what we're learning in class!
    After not being familiar whatsoever with the friend keyword in C++, I did some searching and I
    found a pretty good 8-minute video explaining how it works!
