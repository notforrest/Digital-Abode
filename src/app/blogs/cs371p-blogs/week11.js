    This past week, I began on Project 4: Darwin with my partner! Our progress, I feel, is moving at
    a pretty slow pace but it may just be because of how confusing the project is for us. Trying to
    make sense of how to use all of the different classes in the hierarchy is no easy feat.
    Hopefully once everything clicks, we'll be able to complete the project swiftly.

    The biggest thing in my way for this week is getting a better understanding of Project 4:
    Darwin. The multitude of differing classes is getting me pretty disoriented so I'm planning on
    going to office hours to get a better understanding.

    This upcoming week, I will work on getting the project finished with my partner. There's also a
    lot of work to do with my organization, so being able to manage my time correctly will be of the
    utmost priority.

    With the past couple of papers, they’ve mostly been talking about many of the same, overlapping
    topics. Just as I discussed in previous weeks, the reasoning behind not using getters and
    setters is pretty important to learn, so I’m glad that these papers go in-depth in that concept!

    With initializer_list, I was at first confused, but I believe that was likely due to the syntax
    of initializer_list. I think I already knew the concept behind initializer_list, but I wasn't
    too familiar on the concrete explanation. For vector, it was pretty similar to what we've been
    learning in the class thus far; that wasn't too bad.

    This week, I had a long discussion with my organization, and I feel like we're moving towards a
    better direction for the future of our org. We ran into a few issues with our last event, and
    with our productive talk, the future looks bright!

    My pick-of-the-week is, once again, a video by Marques Brownlee, talking about the legality
    behind the iPhone's USB-C law. Pretty fascinating video in regard to what's happening in the
    world of Big Tech! I think many times we, as computer science majors in college, don't pay much
    attention to political problems, but this tech problem is pretty large in scale and important.
