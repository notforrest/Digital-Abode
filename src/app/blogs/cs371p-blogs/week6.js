    This past week, my partner and I worked a great amount on Project 2: Voting. Over the course of
    the week, we worked around 15-20 hours. One of the activities I didn't do much of this past week
    that I wish I did was boulder more. I wish each day had more than 24 hours in which case I feel
    like I'd be able to do so much more than what I can now.

    Some of the things in my way are pretty constant, such as being able to get all of the tasks on
    my plate finished. Trying to get everything settled through internships, CSA, and classes is
    tough, but I'm trying my best to make it through.

    This upcoming week, I'm looking to be more productive in getting everything done on time. I want
    to get ahead on work whenever I can and being quick and efficient in my work is the best way to
    do that.

    The Open-Closed Principle seems pretty important when producing complete, efficient code. I'm
    having some trouble, however, completely understanding the meaning behind “closed”. Abstraction
    was mentioned in the paper and I got a little bit of a better understanding, but nonetheless
    still need a little more help probably.

    These seem pretty familiar when we learned about them in class! equals() is always an imperative
    function to learn. Iterators are usually difficult to wrap your head around but can just be
    re-understood as pointers. Templates, however, can give me a lot of trouble. I think their use
    case is digestible, but I still have some work to do in that front.

    One of the things that made me most happy was that I did pretty well on an OA finally! I'd
    consider myself pretty lucky in finding a solution to one of the problems, since I kept failing
    the stress tests but after some tinkering, I received max points on that problem! I also got to
    hang out with some of my friends and felt pretty good about that!

    My tip-of-the-week is this Python-related video about descriptors! mCoding on YouTube has some
    great videos and this is no exception.
