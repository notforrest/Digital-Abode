  <>This past week, I've been more relaxed looking forward to the break, which is finally here!</>,

    The main things in my way include making sure I get started on Project 5: Life. Hopefully, this
    project won't be as difficult as Darwin! I just need to start early and get ahead.

    This upcoming week, I will work on getting the project finished with my partner. There's also a
    lot of work to do with my organization, so being able to manage my time correctly will be of the
    utmost priority.

    Paper 13 is a pretty drastic change from what we usually read, but I'm pretty happy that this is
    being brought up for the class to see. It's something that can definitely be swept under the rug
    often in our field of study. I definitely learned something from this and I wish everyone else
    who reads this will, as well!

    Vectors are pretty straightforward and I'm pretty happy to use them! As for inheritance, I'm
    still working on wrapping that around my head and I'm expecting it to be more straightforward
    once I read about it more. Cells are pretty clear to me, but it's classic at this point for the
    project to be much more complex than it first seems.

    This week, I finished up a lot of school stuff and was able to hang out with a lot of my friends
    before we all split for Thanksgiving Break!
  </>,

    My tip for this week is this YouTube Short I've watched on what to use instead of if else
    statements. Using guard clauses seem like a very elegant solution to making code more readable!
