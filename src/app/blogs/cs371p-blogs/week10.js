    This past week, I felt much more relaxed with many of my major projects and assignments being
    finally completed. I was able to have more time to myself, thankfully, and I hope that mental
    reset will help me in the upcoming weeks!

    The biggest thing in my way is being able to produce enough energy through something called
    sleep. I've heard major benefits being produced from this strategy, like better cognitive
    functionality. I'm not too sure if I'm too familiar with that idea, so I'll need to do more
    research on it, but it does sound pretty sweet.

    This next week, I'm going to start looking for a partner for Project 4: Darwin. We haven't heard
    anything about it in class, yet, but I think Professor Downing will explain it soon enough.
    Cheers to hoping that it won't be too difficult. ðŸ¥‚

    I've heard a little bit about getter and setter methods and why they're bad before, but I never
    really understood the reasoning behind it until I read the paper. It's pretty interesting and a
    great read!

    Iteration and initialization seemed pretty self-explanatory and I enjoyed learning about it. A
    more well-acknowledged idea to prop up my idea of what I understand in object-oriented
    programing compared to many of the more mind-numbing topics we've discussed is nice.

    Just today, I had my first official officer dinner with my organization's officers. I've been
    looking forward to this for a while since trying to find a time that 11 people are free is an
    absolute nightmare, but I'm glad it worked out in the end! We ended up going to Din Ho Chinese
    BBQ, and it was amazing! It was pretty pricey, but I'm beyond satisfied with the dishes we
    ordered.

    My pick-of-the-week is a recently released video by Marques Brownlee, where talks about the
    Metaverse and future of it! Pretty fascinating since we're moving closer to a VR future.
