    This week, I worked with my backend team to set up the Amazon RDS with our MySQL schema to
    create a database.

    The main thing in my way is understanding the high number of new tools that we're working with
    for the website. With every new phase, there comes a load of new services to learn and educate
    myself on, so being able to understand them is important to my team's success.

    We still have a good amount of time before Phase II is due, and we have made some pretty good
    progress, so I am not too worried. As for the upcoming week, I will continue working on the
    project and focus my main attention on my upcoming Algorithms test.

    The paper was at first pretty confusing to me, as I'm not too familiar with interfaces and
    classes and seeing the paper compare and contrast with how they're used and misused was not too
    clear. I think after reading it a couple of times and researching online, I should be able to
    understand it far better.

    Yields are a pretty cool piece of tech in Python that allows for interesting workarounds for
    code. As for closures, I was a little more hesitant on how this could be integrated into some
    application, but hopefully I can understand this better as we learn more about it in class.
    Cache seemed pretty straightforward, and I don't believe I had many questions about it.

    I spent a lot of time practicing and playing for my intramural sports teams, as well as getting
    back into climbing. With so many events going on in my organization and academically, I have
    been struggling to keep up with my sports, so I am happy to get back into the groove.

    For my pick-of-the-week, I found this video called Premature Optimization, talking about the
    importance of being careful about when to optimize code if it detracts from some other portion
    of the code. As the top comment notes as a quote from the video, “If your code doesn't work, we
    don't care how fast it doesn't work.”
