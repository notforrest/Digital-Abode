    This past week, I finally worked out some kinks on the project that prevented me from working
    further. Now that I am finished with that, I can work on my part of the next phase of the
    project, which is figuring out the JavaScript portion of the GUI framework.

    The main thing in my way is trying to get ahead of my work. Since I was so busy this past
    weekend, I did not get a lot of work done. Now, I'll need to push hard to make sure that I don't
    fall too far behind on my schoolwork.

    With Phase II starting for the project of this class, there's not much to do except work on
    that. With that in mind, I will need to learn the basics of JavaScript as I've never worked with
    it before, and by the end of this week, I expect to have some progress on this phase of the
    project.

    The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is something that's always going to be applicable in
    object-oriented programming. For our web programming project, I'm not too sure how this
    principle will come to fruition, but the idea of such is undoubtedly a good one to follow.

    We have discussed iterators comprehensively through multiple class periods, so I am pretty
    confident in my knowledge of them. For comprehensions, these were something I learned about
    while studying for coding interviews. They're a nice way to make the code look a little shorter
    and cleaner, while also working for a general situation. Generators are a far more interesting
    topic we learned. It's completely new to me, and at first, I didn't understand the use case for
    it, but I think I'm getting it more now.

    This past weekend, I went camping for the first time with my organization and it was genuinely
    one of the most fun experiences I have ever had. I had thought at first that it would be too
    tedious, but the entire process was such a blast. I would definitely recommend going
    camping/hiking with friends if ever given the chance.

    While browsing YouTube for a pick-of-the-week, I came across something that was related to what
    we're doing now! Basically, it's a tutorial on how to create a “card hover animation” using HTML
    and CSS. Hopefully, we can implement it in our own project!
