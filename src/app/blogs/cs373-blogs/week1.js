    Hi, I am Forrest Sun! I'm a junior that grew up in Spring, Texas, part of the Greater Houston
    Area. For reference, it's about 30 minutes away from downtown Houston.

    I attended Klein High School in Spring, Texas. With a graduating class of around 700 people
    (peaked at 1,100 my freshman year), you could say I was accustomed to being around a lot of
    people.

    My favorite extracurricular activity in high school was being part of the school's student
    television club. I had the chance to go around the school talking to students, getting their
    opinions on topics, as well as go to our sports games and make highlights on those!

    UT seemed like such a lively, upbeat school that I thought it would be perfect for an
    undergraduate college experience! With a prestigious computer science program as well, it seemed
    to be a no-brainer at that point.

    Ever since I was a little kid, I knew I wanted to do something with computers when I grew up. My
    first goal was to be a computer engineer, but I quickly found that hardware was… not my cup of
    tea. After studying four years of computer science in high school, that solidified my opinion in
    moving away from hardware and moving deeper into software. Three years later, I have no regrets!
    Although, If I wasn't accepted into UTCS, I would likely be doing RTF / digital media or
    something like psychology. This ties back into my favorite extracurricular activity in high
    school!

    Taking a software engineering class seems like a fantastic way to get a better understanding of
    what my future career may need me to do. On top of that, taking object-oriented programming with
    Professor Downing last semester was an absolute blast so I can't wait to do it again.

    I expect to learn a lot about web development and what software engineering truly entails. I am
    hoping that after this class, my knowledge of Python, Javascript, and SQL will be far better so
    I am able to utilize it in the field.
  </>,
  <>
    I do not know much about Javascript or web programming, but I have been meaning to learn about
    these as they seem very related to my future career options. As for Python and SQL, I have some,
    albeit very limited, experience in these two languages. Similar to JS and web programming, I
    believe these are vital to succeeding in any front-end development job.

    Surprisingly (should it be surprising?), I thoroughly enjoyed the first couple of lectures.
    Professor Downing has this particular teaching style which I, personally speaking, very much
    enjoy.

    In my past academic experience, I never really had an issue with cold calling, especially when
    nothing is on the line. Either you know it, or you don't, and whatever happens, happens (wow,
    this is a very nonchalant sentence). As for Professor Downing's response to many of the answers
    he received, I think it's safe to say that he has no issue with people not knowing specific
    things (especially when they're really niche!).

    If I had to be completely honest, I wasn't really a fan of this system (or a similar system) in
    one of my previous classes, and I don't think I will approve of this one either. I really do
    understand the thought process behind the grading style — basically, you have to be proficient
    in everything in order to be proficient in the class. The thing is (depending on how hard the
    projects are), it may be very damaging to be slacking in any of the five categories. The four
    non-project gradings seem fairly lenient, as you're allowed to miss a good number of each of
    them. The project specification, though? It's either boom or bust. That's what makes me nervous.

    My team and I hosted a 200-person event just today which I'm happy went very well. The days and
    hours leading up to the event was pretty hectic and somewhat chaotic, but we made it! I had a
    great time, and I think the attendees had a great time, as well, so that was quite the success!

    Searching for one more internship to squeeze in before graduating? You might have seen the
    Summer 2023 megathread for software engineering internships, but did you know there is also a
    Fall 2023 internships megathread as well? If you're interested in finding a co-op, this is
    definitely the place to begin searching. It's pretty empty for now as many Fall internships and
    co-ops are not open yet, but keep an eye on it as they open up.
