    This past week, my team and I submitted our second phase of IDB. This phase was pretty long, so
    I hope it gets better from here.

    The main thing in my way is focusing on getting started on Phase 3 and cleaning up any of the
    rough edges that we still have on the project. I need to make sure that I keep my health up too!

    With this next week being Spring Break, I'm going to just try and relax! Of course, there's
    still the next phase to worry about, but that will come in due time.

    The Dependency Inversion Principle seems pretty fundamental to coding in object-oriented
    languages. Making sure that we have solutions that can be generalized to future evolutions of
    the code is always important in functions.

    This topic is still pretty confusing to me. I missed the last class so after reading over the
    notes for the first time, it's not clear yet what is happening. I'll make sure to read up more
    on this topic!

    This past week, I was happy I could kick back and relax with some of my friends before everyone
    went back home. My friends and I are planning a road trip later this Spring Break, so I'm
    excited about that too!

    For my pick-of-the-week, I have a 4-minute video explaining the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. With
    such a big bubble popping in the tech news world, I think it's important to stay up-to-date,
    even if you're usually not that interested!
