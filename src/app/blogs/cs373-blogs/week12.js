    This past week, my group and I met to split up tasks for the final phase. There is not much to
    do in this phase and it is more about cleaning up the website and code as well as creating
    visualizations.

    There isn't much in my way anymore! With the final phase left for the class, that is all I'll
    need to complete. After that, my other classes do not have much left either.

    Next week, I will work on my task for the final phase. This will be do create visualizations for
    our own website using D3. Since I have mostly only worked on AWS and website hosting, this will
    be a new challenge for me.

    Paper #12 continues to educate us on important rules and ideologies to follow. This paper
    specifically talks about using extend in our code and how it can make it confusing. I've
    understood this previously but seeing it described in detail is quite useful.

    Learning SQL has been interesting thus far since it seems pretty straightforward, and I do think
    it may come in use in the future when working with data. For joins specifically, I can see the
    use cases and how the data involved is manipulated. Refactoring is an important step in every
    coding process to clean it up!

    This week, I traveled with UT CSA to A&M to collaborate with their CSA. We competed in a
    friendly sports tournament and watched some amazing performances. It was a blast and I hope we
    can help host more collaborations like this in the future!

    For my pick-of-the-week, I have another video by CodeAesthetic talking about the proper way to
    describe your code. Instead of commenting complex code, perhaps find a way to refactor or
    reorganize it to simplify it in a way that writing a comment would be redundant.
