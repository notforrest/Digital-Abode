    Over the course of this past week, I worked a lot on the AWS side of our first project. Spending
    a significant amount of time on getting the domain up and running, I thought that it would never
    happen. Thankfully, we got it through and it's working now!

    Making sure I stay on track for the rest of the projects as well as keep up with my health and
    hobbies is my main priority for now. As long as I sleep early and wake up early, productivity
    will come with it.

    This week, I will continue working on the project for this class and assignments for other
    classes. On top of that, I have a couple of important intramural games this week that will send
    us to playoffs if we win.

    The Open-Closed Principle is a pretty fascinating concept. Many of the topics touched on in this
    paper are stuff we have heard before compiled together in a general principle. Abstraction is
    one of those key concepts that are hit in this paper and it seems to always pop up in these
    readings.

    For operators and iterations, it's mostly the same as previous weeks, just with some additional
    material added to it. As for the ethics presentation, I loved it! Last summer, I took the
    Contemporary Issues in Computer Science course here at UT, and it ended up being my favorite
    class I've ever taken. It brings up an engaging conversation, and with AI being so prevalent in
    recent times, it's even more important to educate ourselves to be moral and ethical.

    One of the things I can talk about is that I had a very positive week! I had a final round
    interview with a company I'm looking to intern for. Also, I was able to hang out with my friends
    and detach myself from academics for a little while, so that let me relax a little to end off my
    week.

    For my pick-of-the-week, I chose a recently-released Marques Brownlee video speaking on Bing's
    new AI chatbot and the ramifications of it. He talks about how we're living at the beginning of
    the AI era and I absolutely agree with that, as well as the fact that the world of tech is
    permanently changed.
