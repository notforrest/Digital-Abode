    This past week, my IDB team and I met up to touch base and divvy out tasks so that we would be
    able to finish the project in time. We all have different experiences and backgrounds, so taking
    advantage of our strengths is what we need.

    Some of the things in my way include being able to get my work done this Valentine's weekend.
    With a lot of events coming up, I hope that I can manage my time well enough to both socialize
    and keep up with my schoolwork.

    This upcoming week, my team and I need to finish the IDB project. For my part, I will need to
    establish building the AWS to run our website. This will spur our development of the task of
    creating our first 14 pages. I'm pretty excited to work on this project, as I have never had
    much experience with web development including working with APIs.

    The Single Responsibility Principle is a strong idea to make sure that our code is readable and
    understandable by developers. Sticking to specific ideas for functions allows them to be easily
    debugged and expanded upon. If methods have multiple usages, then confusion can ensue when the
    method is being called. Additionally, splitting responsibilities up allow it to be generalized
    and used for other applications. That itself can be very useful!

    With iterators, they seemed pretty straightforward, as I have some experience with them through
    object-oriented programming and when coding in other languages. For reduce, I have never heard
    about this until Professor Downing brought it up in class. Although I do not think I understand
    the usage fully, it still seems to have its uses. Lastly, for operators, the description of
    their default function is a fascinating concept. Even though it's quite different than many
    other languages, I enjoy that it's unique and debatably simple.

    This week, two of my friends outside of UT Austin came down for the weekend and I was excited to
    hang out with them for the past couple of days! Unfortunately, the fun has to end at some point,
    and it looks like I'll need to go back to focusing on academics. I look forward to the next
    weekend! ðŸ˜ƒ

    For my pick-of-the-week, I chose a recently-released video by The Verge interviewing the
    Microsoft CEO about Bing's new AI technology. Artificial intelligence has been a steaming hot
    topic in the news lately, and its uses continue to both impress and place fear into the
    population. I am truly enthralled to see what is coming up for the AI future.
