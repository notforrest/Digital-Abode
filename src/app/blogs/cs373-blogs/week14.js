    I believe the course did a great job of conveying the above takeaways! I learned a lot through
    the numerous exercises, lectures, and projects that I completed.

    Some of the other takeaways I found from this class were more centered around external factors
    like project cooperation and time management. Working with others throughout this class helped
    me learn a lot about the type of people that I feel I'll be potentially working with in the
    future (in both positive and negative ways).

    Cold calling, in my opinion, can be pretty daunting at first but I think it's pretty helpful,
    only because Professor Downing is an incredibly patient person. If the cold callee forgot
    something on the spot or didn't know the answer, Professor Downing would help guide them through
    the problem every time.

    Specifications grading definitely has upsides and downsides. The main thing that specification
    grading has against it is how frustrating it can be when you do well in every specification
    except one, and that would in turn bring the entire grade down. Professor Downing said he has a
    solution for that, but when he described it, it seemed pretty vague.

    Although I didn't use it much this semester, I did frequently use it last semester. Help
    Sessions were also quite helpful, as TAs could be there in-person to basically help anyone with
    anything. I personally never had a problem with this but Help Sessions can definitely be not as
    helpful when there are a high amount of people going.

    The TAs I got help from, Yuhan and William, were both incredibly helpful in their efforts to
    make sure that we do the best that we can!

    In general, the principles I've learned from these papers were pretty familiar but understanding
    them at a deeper level was nonetheless fascinating.
  </>,
  <>
    Regarding the papers that discussed getters and setters, they were intriguing as well. I've been
    previously taught to avoid getters and setters but I'm glad to have gone far more in-depth on
    the reason “Why?” through these papers, learning specifically about how getters and setters can
    be extremely detrimental to object-oriented programming.

    The tool I had the most experience using during the project was the entire AWS foundation.
    Although it's incredibly specific to web development, the wealth of information I learned will
    be invaluable.
  </>,
  <>
    I think the most helpful tool was probably VSCode's LiveShare. This was a simple way to share
    code between our team and see what each other are doing for an effective experience. Other than
    that, simple communication through Discord is always helpful.

    This was definitely the least exciting and fun part of the entire class structure. If there's
    anything I felt overwhelmed with and disliked, it would be learning all of these massive systems
    by ourselves. We clearly worked through it in the end, but it was mind-bogging at many, many
    times in the process.

    After the end of this class, I can say I easily learned a lot in this class, more than in many
    of my other classes. The aspect of Python programming and web dev seems especially important in
    computer science and my future career path. I am unquestionably satisfied with the knowledge
    that I exited the class with.
