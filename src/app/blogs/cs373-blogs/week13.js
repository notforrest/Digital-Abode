    This past week, my team and I worked on the final phase of the project. There is not much left
    to do, as we're finally on the home stretch!

    With my final test for Algorithms coming, I'm a little nervous in taking a pen-and-paper test
    with my dominant hand wrapped in a cast, but we'll see!

    Next week, I will be completing the rest of my assignments for all of my classes. Luckily,
    there's not much left to do for the rest of the semester, so it's more about cleaning up the
    loose ends.

    For Paper #13, this is an extremely important topic to talk about and I'm glad that Professor
    Downing included this in the papers. Even though this may not be directly related to our code,
    it is still heavily present in the field. It pains me to hear about these issues that should
    have been closed many decades ago, but hopefully, I will be able to keep this in mind as I enter
    the workforce.

    Regarding refactoring, the concept is pretty simple but I am not too sold on how to properly get
    it to work. When doing in-class exercises, it seems pretty straightforward, but I think in
    larger programs, it will be a lot more difficult to handle. Strategy patterns have also been
    pretty confusing for me, but I think I'll be able to get them the longer I study them.

    Despite the fact that I broke my finger, I was pretty happy this week hanging out with friends
    and eating at places I haven't yet tried. With only one more week left of school, I am excited
    to see what's to come in the summer!

    For my tip-of-the-week, I chose the teaser video of GitHub Copilot X in Visual Studio! This will
    be an incredible feature for the public to begin using and I wonder what else Microsoft has
    working behind the scenes.
